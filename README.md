## Getting Started 🏁

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js:** (v14 or higher recommended)
- **npm:** (Usually bundled with Node.js)

You can check your versions by running:

```bash
node -v
npm -v

Installation 📥
Clone the repository:

git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>

Install dependencies:

npm install

Development 🛠️
Start the development server:

npm start

This will open your default browser to http://localhost:3000/.  Any changes you make to your code will be reflected in the browser instantly, without needing a manual refresh.

Production 🚀
Build an optimized production-ready version of your app:

npm run build

This will generate the production build in the build directory, ready to be deployed to your web server.
